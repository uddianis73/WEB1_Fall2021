      Netflix is one of the biggest  paid streaming services in the world. I used to have a Netflix and it was great, but I canceled my subscription because I only watch anime now. Netflix has a lot of tv shows to watch, but they got rid of a bunch of good movies. One way to watch more tv shows and movies on Netflix is to use a VPN and change your region. In 2021, Netflix has about 209 million paid users using their service globally.

      Twitch is a live-streaming service that is owned by the company Amazon. It was launched on June 6th, 2011 that is almost 10 and a half years ago. I personally don't use Twitch mcuh because I do not watch many livestreams. Out of all the live-streaming services avaliable I feel like the Twitch is the most comfortable to use. Twitch is free with ads and streamers on Twitch make money from donations and subscriptions to their channels.
